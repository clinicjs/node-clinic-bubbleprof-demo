# Bubbleprof Example

This is an example of a small real world-ish program. It contains an import script (`import-npm.js`) that imports the npm registry metadata into a mongodb running on localhost and a series of servers showcasing problems and improvements.

The mongodb will contain two collections `slow` and `fast` which contain the same data, except `fast` will contain an index for doing fast lookups and `slow` will not.

If you have docker installed you can install and run a mongo container by doing.

```sh
docker pull mongo
docker run -it -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

Then to import some data

```sh
# note you can just run this for a bit and kill it
node import-npm.js
```

There are 3 iterations of a server that returns the 5 latest and 5 oldest updated modules on npm.

1. Returns the latest and oldest 5 modules from an *unindexed* collection
1. Returns the latest and oldest 5 modules from an *indexed* collection
1. Returns the same as `/b` but does the queries in parallel.

Each should produce different bubbleprof results indicating the async profile of each:

Running `1` you should see a ton of latency:

```sh
clinic bubbleprof --on-port 'autocannon localhost:$PORT/' -- node 1-server-with-no-index.js
```

Running `2` you should see much more throughput:

```sh
clinic bubbleprof --on-port 'autocannon localhost:$PORT/' -- node 2-server-with-index.js
```

Running `3` you should see some more branches in the async graph:

```sh
clinic bubbleprof --on-port 'autocannon localhost:$PORT/' -- node 3-server-with-index-in-parallel.js
```
